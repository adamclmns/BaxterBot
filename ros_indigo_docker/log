Installing and Setting up Docker
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/
    NOTE: Didn't do any of that crap. I just ran 
        $> sudo apt-get install docker docker-compose
    Using Ubuntu 17.10, due to hardware constraints (cpu support)

    https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/linux-postinstall/
    NOTE: I did actually need to run the post-install step to run "docker" as non-root
        $> sudo useradd -aG docker $USER
    Log out and Back in required. 
    NOTE: If you can run 
        $> docker hello-world
    and see the "Hello from docker" with a bunch of output about docker versions, then
    all is well. see screeshot_001.png for example.

    Followed this tutorial as a nice refresher for using docker
    https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#setup
